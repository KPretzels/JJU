Subject: “ZENESIS” bike distribution cooperation and meeting schedule proposal
Dear Mr. Kim,

I am John, Senior Executive Director at Bike Corporation. I recently learned about your new bicycle model, "ZENESIS," through your press release. Bike Corporation is a company that leads innovation and quality in the field of bicycle manufacturing and distribution, with long-time experience and expertise in this field.

We would like to request a detailed brochure for the ZENESIS model. In particular, we need information on technical specifications, battery performance, and design aspects. This information will help us further refine our proposed distribution strategy and marketing plan.

Additionally, to discuss the possibilities for collaboration in more detail, I propose a meeting next Tuesday, January 15th, at 10:00 AM. Would it be possible to meet at your office to have this discussion?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Johnm
Senior Executive Director
Bike Corporation
